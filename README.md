# Detecting Routines: Implications for Ridesharing CRM

Code repository to accompany Detecting Routines: Implications for Ridesharing CRM, which is conditionally accepted for publication at the Journal of Marketing Research.

The model code relies on python/PyMC/NumPyro. The results are analyzed using a mixture of Python and R. 

The python requirements are in the included `requirements.txt` file. Benchmark models may have their own requirements. The code was run using python version `3.10.5`.
